  - 'Advent Campaign Setting
  
  The year is 2319. Humanity has spread throughout the solar system, colonizing the planets, the asteroid belt and many of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and building a large number of free-floating space cities in orbit around the planets and the sun itself. Fusion engines make space travel economical but the secrets of faster than light travel remain elusive.
  Humans have observed the presence of extraterrestrials in the galaxy, but not made direct contact. Two hundred years ago, astronomers witnessed a large scale battle in the system around the nearby star Epsilon Eridani, resulting in the destruction of the star and its planets. This event had an extreme galvanizing impact on every aspect of human culture, as humanity realized how vulnerable they are. The formation of the United Solar System government soon followed, which was primarily concerned with keeping human civilization hidden from the galaxy and with developing system-scale defensive capabilities. Some private organizations reacted differently, secretly devoting vast resources to developing the ability to contact aliens or enable small groups of humans to travel beyond the solar system in order to join the galactic community. The government cracks down violently on these efforts when they are discovered.
  
  Ancient ruins of alien engineering have been discovered on mars and on Europa, the moon of Jupiter, but were quickly locked down by the United Solar System government, and little is known about them.
  
  You are a crew of space adventurers for hire, bounty-hunters, treasure-hunters, mercenaries. 
  
  Mission Introduction: Callisto Dig Site
  
  You have responded to an urgent contact by an executive from the Pythagoras Corporation, a large company involved in mining and advanced physics research.
  
  Pythagoras owns and operates a mining colony on Jupiters moon Callisto. Some months ago, extraterrestrial ruins were discovered deep under the surface. The company kept this secret, and the facility was repurposed for research on the alien artifacts.
  
  24 hours ago, the facility was attacked by a group of radical cultists for who learned about the alien. Before communications were cut off, the core group of researchers reported that they had activated the facility’s automatic defenses and retreated to an inner security bunker.
  For obvious reasons, Pythagoras Corporation does not want to involve either the government of Callisto or the United Solar System Federation.
  
  Your mission is to rescue the researchers, and regain control of the facility.
  
  Mission 2: Weywot station intercept
  
  Mission 3: Rescue from Charon
  
  Mission: The Rhadamanthus Investigation
  
  You’ve received an exclusive tip off that Laredo Logistics, one of the largest and most aggressively expansive mining corporations in the system, is illegally experimenting with extreme biomodification of their miners, most of whom are prisoners contracted from penal systems on Earth and colonies throughout the system. Laredo has reportedly hired Dr Rasthmus Rhadamanthus to supervise the operation. wanted by every government in the system for develoment of biological weapons and illegal crimes against humanity and nature.
  
  Rhadamanthus is apparently selling some of his new tech on the black market to exclusive clients, and your informant can set up a meeting to visit the facility on asteroid Laredo 86-z-17 and make a purchase. (requires escrow of $1m)
  
  Alternately, you can land attempt to 
  
  Potential objectives:
  - obtain proof that Laredo Logistics is experimenting with illegal biomodification, allowing you to blackmail or whistleblow against them
  - identify Rhadamanthus on asteroid Laredo 86-z-17
  - arrest/abduct Rhadamanthus: he is worth a massive bounty, especially alive; governments will bid extravagantly for the chance to try and execute him

  Hello okay
  so to work on the Advent campaign setting a little bit
  right so the players arrive Merida city
  as a space elevator so in partnership with the top
  take the space elevator down I guess that should have some costs like 100 bucks player or something
  so theres other ships parked up at the top including Big freighters and stuff. And a lot of miners like hitch rides on the prison ships are coming in with fears of miners that are going to work in the mines that are contracted out to Laredo from prisons all over the galaxy all over the solar system.
  And so you can take the space elevator down and leave your ship up in orbit of the asteroid and you can keep it closed up there. So its not spidered by any of the terrorists which is important later if you want to use your ship to extract yourself and the client who youre supposed to be rescuing.
  So you leave your ship up in orbit, either auto piloted if you take the full crew down or you can suppose that one of the theres a crew mate on the ship that can relay commands, but generally I think if one of the players is playing the pilot, then the pilot should be responsible for sort of ordering the ships autopilot to come pick them up and stuff like that.
  Thats the thought. So they leave the ship up at the top.
  You leave the ship up at the top and read space elevator down.
  It takes just a couple of hours in this mag mag living thing you can see the asteroid. Get a birds eye view of the asteroid as you come down. Oh yeah, lets get and so you can see the map you can see that theres this huge crack thats kind of splitting the asteroid and youre coming down to this spaceport thats kind of right along this ridge with this huge yawning crack that goes like just as far as you can see down into the asteroid.
  And then theres you can see the kind of glittering metal of a train tracks that goes across this chasm from the spaceport goes off into the distance. And you see these big glittering metal towers every so often along the horizon of the asteroid.
  Yeah, that in the train tracks appear to go from kind of along this ridge and theres towers along this ridge and they kind of go down in that direction.
  in two different directions as you come down on, on on the atmosphere. So theres this this railroad and you connect to the spaceport and so you know from having studied the briefing and stuff where Laredo is, you can see that on the map.
  I mean, where this where the right amounts is mine is.
  So you can point that out. Its like two train stops down two towers. Down. Its narrow tower that kind of protects the area of the asteroid where it is offers like air defense.
  Which also means that you cant fly your ship in there while the towers still active. So if you want to get your ship in there and you will have to disable the tower.
  So thats like a sub goal is to disable the tower if you want to use your ship to extract otherwise youll have to like travel back overland to the spaceport in order to escape, which could be difficult if youre taking anyone with you, you know.
  Yeah, tough points of the land and they can take the train for cost
  Yeah, they can take the train for cost or they can try to travel Overland.
  I guess if they take the train dont need to be ID by Laredo.
  Can I do it anonymously or maybe bribe to go in scanned?
  Yeah, so fly gameplay options.
  Lets pause and export
  Okay moving on so they space for
  supposing they just take the train
  I guess theres two options that you have two forks that you both need to describe which is taking the train drove on overland and on the map you can indicate it as a choice of routes
  kind of zoomed in view with a choice of routes.
  The call like corresponds to one of the maps that you have
  so, they take one of those two routes and you do not describe was was another one they arrive yeah at this tower and lets see, how did you describe it to Josh and Emily
  I guess folks buy their equipment, their environment domes and spacesuits and mining equipment. You buy that stuff back at the city, but people are kind of like marshaling to head out into the field at the tower.
  But theres a bunch of sort of fascist corporate fascist Laredo goons hanging around
  yeah, and then people sort of fan out and go to these freehold mines and theres various kind of mining operations around and then you you know where the random math is mine
  I guess you know, you can add, you know, the name of a contact asked so you can ask around there and try to find the contact and say that youre a client or represent a client.
  You kind of come up with a story.
  And then this guy will show you a new name for the guy sounds like cause
  
  
  two routes: train or overland
  
  the overland route follows a series of landmarks, particularly Smuggler’s Gap, which is where the chasm narrows to a set of rippled canyons, offering the only place to cross the chasm under cover from long range sensor scans.
