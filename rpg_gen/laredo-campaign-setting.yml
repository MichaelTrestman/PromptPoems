  Plot hook: You’ve received an exclusive tip off that Laredo Logistics, one of the largest and most aggressively expansive mining corporations in the system, is illegally experimenting with extreme biomodification of their miners, most of whom are prisoners contracted from penal systems on Earth and colonies throughout the system. Laredo has reportedly hired Dr Rasthmus Rhadamanthus to supervise the operation. wanted by every government in the system for develoment of biological weapons and illegal crimes against humanity and nature.

Rhadamanthus is apparently selling some of his new tech on the black market to exclusive clients, and your informant can set up a meeting to visit the facility on asteroid Laredo 86-z-17 and make a purchase. (requires escrow of $1m)

Alternately, you can land attempt to 

Potential objectives:
- obtain proof that Laredo Logistics is experimenting with illegal biomodification, allowing you to blackmail or whistleblow against them
- identify Rhadamanthus on asteroid Laredo 86-z-17
- arrest/abduct Rhadamanthus: he is worth a massive bounty, especially alive; governments will bid extravagantly for the chance to try and execute him

    I admire your guts. We need supplies, and you look like you have something to

    few crates are stacked haphazardly in the corner, some bearing the Laredo insignia.
    You spot a rusty old map pinned to the wall, detailing the layout of the asteroid,
    and a couple of makeshift weapons lying around, indicating that these smugglers
    are prepared for trouble.


    The scarred man continues, \\\\u201cIf we can get into the lab and gather evidence,
    we can expose them. But we need someone who can navigate the corporate defenses
    and get past the enforcers. We can help you with the smuggling routes and provide

- content: '"**You gather your team and the smugglers at the entrance to the jagged
    tunnels leading to the surface of Laredo 86-z-17. The air is thick with tension
    as the realities of your surroundings settle in. This asteroid is no ordinary
    place; its irregular surface is a treacherous landscape of sharp rocks, deep crevices,
    and unstable terrain. The miners work in atmosphere-containing force-field domes,
    but outside, the dangers are many, and the whispers of disasters caused by power
    failures echo through the community.**


    **As you step outside, the harsh light of the distant sun glints off the jagged
    edges of the landscape. You can see the domes scattered across the surface, like
    bubbles of safety in a sea of danger. The atmosphere is thin, and you can feel
    the chill in the air, a reminder that each breath is a luxury. Your crew adjusts
    their space suits, ensuring they are sealed tight, while the smugglers prepare
    their personal jetpacks, sleek and compact, designed for stealthy movement across
    the asteroid''s surface.**


    **You take a moment to assess the layout of the terrain. Craggy outcrops and steep
    slopes dominate the landscape, making it a challenge to navigate without being
    spotted. Ahead of you, the horizon stretches into the distance, dotted with various
    mining operations and the occasional patrol of enforcers. You can make out the
    distant shimmer of the Rhadamanthus Lab Facility, nestled among the rugged cliffs,
    a dark reminder of the peril that lies ahead.**


    **Your bodies feel the weight of the suits, heavy but necessary for survival in
    this harsh environment. The jetpacks hum softly as they power up, providing a
    sense of freedom and urgency. You can feel the adrenaline coursing through your
    veins, a mix of excitement and apprehension as you prepare to embark on this dangerous
    journey. The urge to protect your crew and the miners fuels your resolve, while
    the fear of the unknown lingers at the back of your mind.**


    **Looking around, you gauge the emotions of your team. Zane \"Ghost\" Mercer appears
    focused, his eyes scanning the terrain for potential threats. Dr. Elara \"Doc\"
    Williams checks her medkit, ensuring she has everything she might need for emergencies.
    Dax \"Bull\" Ryker stands tall, his posture radiating confidence, ready for whatever
    may come. The smugglers, Rax, Kira, Jax, and Mira, seem eager yet cautious, their
    faces set with determination.**


    **You gather everyone close, raising your voice over the distant sounds of machinery.
    \\\\u201cAlright, team. Our goal is to reach the perimeter of the Rhadamanthus
    Lab Facility undetected. We will use the jetpacks to travel across the surface,
    keeping low and moving quickly. Stay alert for patrols and be ready to adjust
    our route as needed. Let\u2019s move out!\\\\u201d**


    **With that, you all activate your jetpacks, the soft hum of the engines propelling
    you into the air. The world below rushes by as you glide over the rugged surface,
    your hearts racing with the thrill of flight. The jagged rocks and craters create
    a stunning yet dangerous landscape beneath you.**


    **As you soar, you keep your eyes peeled for any signs of patrols. The enforcers
    are known to be vigilant, but the stealth offered by the jetpacks gives you a
    significant advantage. You can see the domes of the mining operations below, some
    workers moving about their tasks, oblivious to the dangers lurking in the shadows.**


    **Suddenly, a warning chime emits from your commlink; Zane has spotted movement
    ahead. You notice a patrol of enforcers making their way toward a nearby dome,
    their armored suits glinting in the harsh light. They seem to be scanning the
    area for any signs of trouble, and you realize you need to make a decision quickly.**


    **You can:**


    1. **Change your course and fly low to avoid the patrol, taking a longer route
    but staying out of sight.**


    2. **Prepare to create a distraction** by having Kira and Jax set something off
    near the patrol while the rest of you slip past unnoticed.


    3. **Decide to engage the patrol**, using the element of surprise to incapacitate
    them before continuing your mission.

    enough concealment from the patrol above.**


    **You land softly, the muted thud of your suit barely audible against the harsh,
    uneven ground. The others follow suit, landing with practiced grace and moving
    quickly to nestle into the shadows of the crevice. The air is cool, and the faint

    we could slip past them if we time it right. But we need to be careful. There
    might be more patrols nearby.\\\\\\\\u201d**


    **You feel the weight of the moment settle upon you. The decision ahead could
    shape the course of your mission. The thought of gathering evidence against Rhadamanthus
    drives you forward, but the risks are evident. The jagged rocks around you provide
    some cover, but you know that staying too long could lead to being spotted.**


    **You can:**


    1. **Wait for the patrol to move on,** then make a stealthy dash across open ground
