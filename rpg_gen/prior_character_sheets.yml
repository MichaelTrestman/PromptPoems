    ### Inventory
  
    Currently you are imprisoned and have nothing but rough clothing and the manacles on your feet... as far as your jailers know.
    However, you took the precaution of swallowing a ring that serves as your backup focus before being arrested. Now that youâ€™ve recovered it, the first thing you should do is probably wash your hands
  
  
    ### **Tactics and Playstyle:**
    - **Escape and Survival:** 
      - Use **Misty Step** to quickly move out of dangerous situations or through small gaps.
      - **Invisibility** allows you to evade capture or surveillance, especially after recovering your ring.
  
    - **Trickery and Deception:**
      - **Disguise Self** to blend in with guards or other prisoners, avoiding detection.
      - **Minor Illusion** and **Silent Image** to create distractions or hide pathways.
      - **Nondetection** can help keep you hidden from magical attempts to find you.
  
    - **Utility:**
      - **Mage Hand Legerdemain** lets you pick locks or steal small objects without being noticed.
      - **Alarm** can be used to detect incoming threats during rest or while setting up an ambush.
