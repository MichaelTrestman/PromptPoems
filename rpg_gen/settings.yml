settings:
  - In a world where gravity is unpredictable and fluctuates wildly, cities are built on giant floating platforms that drift across the sky. Society revolves around "gravity smiths" who can temporarily stabilize gravity fields. The constant motion of the platforms creates a nomadic lifestyle where resources are scarce and innovation is key.
  - The world is dominated by colossal fungal forests that spread spores everywhere, creating a hallucinogenic environment. Civilization exists in massive biodomes to protect against the spore influence. However, certain factions worship the fungi and live outside the domes, seeking to merge with the forest consciousness.
  - A post-apocalyptic desert wasteland where technology and magic have fused. The remnants of humanity survive in scattered oasis cities powered by ancient tech-magic reactors. Warlords and sorcerers battle for control of the scarce resources, while mysterious desert spirits influence events.
  - A world covered entirely in dense jungle, with cities built in the treetops. The ground is overrun by dangerous, hyper-evolved predators, so humans live among the canopy. The society is tribal, and the "Sky Rangers" are elite warriors who protect the tree cities and explore the deadly ground below.
  - In a steampunk Victorian-era city powered by steam and clockwork technology, an eternal fog blankets the streets. Strange creatures lurk in the mist, and the city is divided into the elite who live in towering spires above the fog, and the underclass who dwell in the perpetual gloom below.
